# Emotion Detection with DeepFace

This is a Python program that detects emotions in images and in real-time from a camera using the DeepFace library and OpenCV.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<rshiramss>/<Real-time-Emotion-Detection-with-DeepFace-and-OpenCV>.git`
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To run the program, use the command `python main.py` in the terminal.

When the program is running, you will be prompted to enter a choice:

- Enter 'i' to upload an image
- Enter 'c' for real-time camera emotion detection
- Enter 'q' to quit

If you choose to upload an image, you will be prompted to enter the path to the image file. The program will then detect emotions in the image and display the result.

If you choose real-time camera emotion detection, the program will open a window showing the camera feed. The program will detect emotions in the faces in the feed and display the result in real-time.
